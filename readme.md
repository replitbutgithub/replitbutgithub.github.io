# Welcome to ReplOS!
### ReplOS is an Operating System written in Replit's Bash shell.
### In ReplOS, you can run a basic Linux OS on any computer (with a bit of lag)!
## How to start ReplOS
### To start ReplOS, go to the "Shell" tab (next to this "Markdown" tab).
### Type in the name of the application you would like to start, starting with bash and ending with ".sh".
* #### Don't include the $, the shell pre-includes it in all commands.
### Example:
```Bash
$ bash chrome.sh
```
### To see a list of possible application commands, go to the "List of Commands" section.
## How to download files from ReplOS
### To download a file from ReplOS, simply download it to the external drive "ReplOS" when saving the file.
### It will show up in the _files_ tab when you do this!
### You can download your file by clicking the 3 dots next to the file and pressing "Download"!
### If you want to upload a file to ReplOS, simply click the 3 dots to the far right of "Files".
### Click Upload File.
### Upload the file you want uploaded!
### If you want a folder uploaded, same policy applies, except click the "Upload Folder" button instead of the "Upload File" button!
### __! IMPORTANT !__
### Zip files don't work the same as regular files. When uploaded normally, it will read as gibberish. If you want to upload a zip archive, use the "Upload Folder" button. It will turn the .zip into a folder.
## Ignore the following:
* #### `main.sh`
* #### `.replit`
* #### `chrome.sh`
* #### `firefox.sh`
* #### `readme.md`
### These files are needed for startup. You won't have downloaded any of these, and they don't have anything you need downloaded.
## Audio
### To turn on audio, click the box next to the headphones in the corner.
## List of Commands
